## Usage

Suppose, we need to encrypt data in `inbuf` with AES-128-CTR & put the encrypted
data into `outbuf`:

```c
/* ... ... are to be replaced with appropriate values. */
const unsigned char inbuf[100] = ... data ...; /* Plain text. */
const unsigned char key[16] = ... key ...; /* Key to encrypt `inbuf` with. */
unsigned char outbuf[100]; /* Destination of encrypted data. */
```

First, we would initialize the AES context with `aes_init` function:

```c
AesContext ctx;
aes_init(&ctx, KEY_TYPE_AES128, key);
```

Then, we would use `aes_ctr_xcrypt()` to encrypt the data:

```c
/* Set initial IV. Replace with appropriate value. */
const unsigned char iv[16] = ... iv ...;
unsigned char new_iv[16]; /* New IV. */

aes_ctr_xcrypt(&ctx, sizeof outbuf, outbuf, inbuf, iv, new_iv);
```

## API

For more information, see [aes.h](include/ay/aes.h).

### Initialization

Initialize `AesContext` using `aes_init(ctx, key_size, key)` where
- `ctx` is pointer to `AesContext`
- `key_size` = 128, 192, 256 for AES-128, AES-192 & AES-256 respectively
- `key` is pointer to AES key

### ECB mode
- For encrypting data using ECB mode, use `aes_ecb_encrypt`.
- For decrypting data using ECB mode, use `aes_ecb_decrypt`.

### CBC mode
- For encrypting data using CBC mode, use `aes_cbc_encrypt`.
- For decrypting data using CBC mode, use `aes_cbc_decrypt`.

### CTR mode
For encrypting or decrypting data using CTR mode, use `aes_ctr_xcrypt`.
